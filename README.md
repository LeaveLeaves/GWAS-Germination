# GWAS-Germination
R project to analyze GWAS data in rice
I put 225 samples from different japonica rice species' seeds which have not strong population strcuture under 16â„ƒ temperuature for 14 day and record the number of germination for 8 days. After that I got the sequencing data of these species,now I am going to use R project to analyze these data to identificate genes associated with rice low-temperuature tolerance ability.
